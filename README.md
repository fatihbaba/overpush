## Overview

**Overpush** is a self-hosted solution designed to replace Pushover. It uses XMPP as its delivery method while maintaining compatibility with the existing Pushover API. This means you can seamlessly integrate Overpush into your current setups, such as Grafana, with minimal changes. Simply update the API URL, and you're ready to go.

## Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Run Overpush on your own server for full control over your notifications.
- **XMPP Delivery**: Utilizes XMPP for efficient message delivery.
- **API Compatibility**: Keeps the same API structure as Pushover, making migration easy.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to install and configure.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help it grow.

## Getting Started

To get started with Overpush, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from our [Releases page](https://github.com/fatihbaba/overpush/releases).
2. **Extract the files** and navigate to the Overpush directory.
3. **Configure your settings** in the `config.json` file.
4. **Run the application** using the command:
   ```bash
   ./overpush
   ```

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A server with XMPP support.
- Basic knowledge of JSON for configuration.
- An understanding of your existing Pushover setup.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download

Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/fatihbaba/overpush/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to download the appropriate file for your system.

### Step 2: Configuration

Open the `config.json` file in your favorite text editor. Hereâ€™s a basic example of what the configuration might look like:

```json
{
  "xmpp": {
    "host": "your.xmpp.server",
    "port": 5222,
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  },
  "api": {
    "port": 8080
  }
}
```

Adjust the settings according to your server and requirements.

### Step 3: Run Overpush

Once configured, you can start Overpush with the following command:

```bash
./overpush
```

## Usage

After starting Overpush, you can send messages using the same API calls as Pushover. Hereâ€™s a quick example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your.overpush.server/send \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "token": "your_api_token",
  "user": "user_key",
  "message": "Hello, Overpush!"
}'
```

### API Endpoints

Overpush supports the following API endpoints:

- **Send Message**: `POST /send`
- **Get Status**: `GET /status`

For detailed API documentation, refer to the `API.md` file in the repository.
